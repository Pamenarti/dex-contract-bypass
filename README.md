# Dex Contract Bypass Exploit

## Overview
This exploit targets vulnerabilities in decentralized exchange (DEX) contracts that allow for bypassing certain security measures. The goal is to demonstrate how an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate trades or drain liquidity.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of smart contracts and Ethereum blockchain.
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Web3.js library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.



## How It Works
The exploit works by:
- Interacting with the DEX contract to identify vulnerabilities.
- Sending crafted transactions that exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass security checks.
- Manipulating the state of the contract to achieve the attacker's goals.

## Disclaimer
This exploit is for educational purposes only. Use it at your own risk and ensure you have permission to test any contracts you interact with. Unauthorized access to systems is illegal and unethical.
